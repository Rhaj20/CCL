In this diary, I'll write about all the things I've done during these 2 weeks of Creative CodeLab:
- 14 January 2025: Today, to start my game's code, I followed the example of the jump and run game we did in 2DBGC, since my game is pretty similar to it./ I also started drawing a spritesheet of my character (still not done) and the drawing of my shelf object and I started trying to implement them in my code but my drawings in my spritesheet don't appear well.
- 15 January 2025: The applygravity function was not working well so Lukas sent us the updated one by email, when I pasted it in my code, my character stopped jumping, I didn't understand where the problem came from till I went over my whole code and changed the value of global.playerObject.setJumpForce from .8 to 10./ I also fixed the problem of the images of my spritesheet now we can see the images clearly when the cat is walking./ I had a problem with my canvas too, because at some point in the canvas my cat was disappearing from the canvas, and I fixed it by just fixing the width size of the canvas in the html from 1000 to 1500 and now my cat doesn't disppear just stops when it's close to the end of the background.
- 16 January 2025: On this day I decided to focus mostly on my background drawing so that I would know where to place all of my different elements on the screen. It took a long time to do all the drawings in the background but at the end when I was done, it was easier to place my cat and my shelfs... on the screens. At the end of the day, i tried to implement my owner (enemy) on the screen but it was getting too complicated (because it had random directions it went to) so I decide to leave it for the next day.
- 17 January 2025: I had a problem with my background, it was duplicating when I was sliding through it so I was able to fix it./ I was also able to fix (thanks to Florian) till where my cat would go, now it could reach almost the end of the background/ I also tried fixing the directions my owner goes in and I changed it from top,  bottom, left and right to only left and right
- During the weekend, I mainly just drew some of the drawings I needed
- 20 January 2025: I worked on the rest of my drawings, I also fixed the switch of sprites when my owner walks in different directions and I fixed the size of my canvas.
- 21 January 2025: I fixed the life display so that when the cat and the owner collide, lives are taken off. I figured out how to make the game over screen apppear as well/ I started redrawing my background as well to make it longer and better
- 22 January 2025: I finally fixed my loading problem,my character appears now on the screen all the time, I also placed my pan, pot and objects on the screen and fixed the collision detection with them cause it was a bit messed up at the beginning/ I finished redrawing my background
- 23 January 2025: I set all my elements in the canvas right where I wanted them, when I did that I had a problem with the collision between my door element and my cat but I fixed it by fixing the canvas/ I made the starting and end screen
